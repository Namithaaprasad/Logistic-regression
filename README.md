# Logistic-regression
Logistic regression on churn data of  a network

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn based on a telecom dataset. The data includes customer demographics, service details (such as internet, phone, and streaming services), contract types, tenure, and billing information. The objective is to classify whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the telecom service) or stay, enabling proactive retention strategies. The notebook walks through data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. After training the Logistic Regression model, its performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics. As a simple and interpretable baseline model, Logistic Regression helps highlight the key factors influencing churn and supports decision-making in customer lifecycle management.
